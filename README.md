# Takeaway Challenge

[Exercise instructions are here](takeaway-challenge.md)

## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. `bundle install`
3. Copy `twilio-config-EXAMPLE` to `twilio-config-PRIVATE` (the latter is protected by `.gitignore`)
4. Enter your Twilio credentials and phone numbers in `twilio-config-PRIVATE`

## Instructions

First load Twilio credentials: `source ./twilio-config-PRIVATE`.

Then:

```ruby
‚ûú irb -r ./lib/takeaway.rb      
2.5.0 :001 > t = Takeaway.new
 => #<Takeaway...> 
2.5.0 :002 > t.menu
 => [{:name=>"Mixed Meze", :price=>10}, {:name=>"Lahmacun", :price=>4}, {:name=>"Chicken Shish", :price=>10}, {:name=>"Iskender", :price=>12}, {:name=>"Icli Kofe", :price=>12}, {:name=>"Baklava", :price=>6}] 
2.5.0 :003 > t.pretty_menu
O¬∫¬∞‚Äò¬® Welcome to Grill Communication! ¬®‚Äò¬∞¬∫O
0: Mixed Meze, ¬£10
1: Lahmacun, ¬£4
2: Chicken Shish, ¬£10
3: Iskender, ¬£12
4: Icli Kofe, ¬£12
5: Baklava, ¬£6
 => nil 
2.5.0 :005 > t.add_to_order 2, 1
 => [{:name=>"Chicken Shish", :price=>10}] 
2.5.0 :006 > t.add_to_order 1, 2
 => [{:name=>"Chicken Shish", :price=>10}, {:name=>"Lahmacun", :price=>4}, {:name=>"Lahmacun", :price=>4}] 
2.5.0 :007 > t.total
 => 18 
2.5.0 :008 > t.confirm(18)
 => true 
```

We will confirm delivery time by text message. Bon appetit! üë®‚Äçüç≥

## My method

I tried my best to use a strict TDD approach:
1. Convert user story into a feature test in `spec/features/user_stories_spec.rb`
2. When that fails make a unit test for the failing class which fails in the same way
3. Write the minimal code to fix the feature and unit test failures
4. Repeat until the feature is implemented
5. Refactor, rinse, repeat

I didn't attempt to implement ordering via SMS, but I did have it in my mind as I was working on the exercise. That's why I chose for my `Takeaway.add_to_order` method to identify the menu items via an index which is printed in the `Takeaway.pretty_menu` - I thought that would be an easier interface to interact with via SMS then having to e.g. type out the name of each order item.

Having the identifier for the menu items being the array index seems fragile - it means adding more items to the menu will cause the identifiers to change. Not a problem with the current implementation, but for future extensibility I think it would be better for each menu item to have a fixed, unique identifier.

I'd also like the basket to be emptied when you confirm your order, but I didn't get around to that :)

Rubocop is clear and RSpec test coverage is 100% and green at time of writing.

### Classes and responsibilities:
- `Takeaway` - provides the user interface
- `Menu` - contains the menu items and methods for getting and checking menu items, and formatting the menu for display
- `Order` - provides a basket to hold order items, methods to add and remove from it, and to confirm the order
- `MessagerTwilio` - provides a method to send an SMS via the Twilio service
- `MessagerStdout` - provides a method to print a message to STDOUT. A drop-in replacement for `MessagerTwilio` that I used in testing
- `Dish` - I was close to extracting a class for a `dish` object for the menu items, but it seemed too pointless since the functionality you need for the current implementation can be achieved with a hash... but I think it could help make the program more extensible, e.g. by allowing you to keep a record of how many times particular dishes have been ordered
